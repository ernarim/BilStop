### How to execute software

For the app to work you need to add your Google Maps API key to the "api_key" in the strings.xml file. Your key must be connected to a payment account.<br />
Another way to make the app work is by sending us your SHA1 key. This way we can connect your computer to our api key and the app will work.<br />
